call the object's methods, such as increment and setValue.
#2 A class diagram can be changed when there is a change to be made. It changes by having it's properties or fields altered.
#3 An object diagram can be changed to present a different look. It changes by having it's visual representation altered.

#6 An increment should be transfered from minute to hour after there is one rotation in the minute section.
#8 The Value is changed when it is lower than the limit but when it is higher, it does not give an output and resets to 0
#9 Both values resulted in 0 since both values were only set to 10 and not given 10 increments.
#10 The method I used is not a proper method since I'm calling on the class and not the object.
#11 The error mentions the prompt missing a .class to proccess it.
#12 The change allows the increment to reach the number of the limit but not pass it without resetting.
#13 Anything ( >0 but < limit )
#15 ! (4 < 5), false
! false, True
(2 > 2) ((4 == 4) && (1 < 0)) ││, False
(2 > 2) (4 == 4) && (1 < 0) ││, False
(34 != 33) && ! false, True
#16 (a && b) || (!a && !b)
#17(33 != 32) && ! false
#18 it is a 3 digit string.
